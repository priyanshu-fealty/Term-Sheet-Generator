# Term Sheet Validation Report

**5 issues identified:**

## Issue 1: Anti-dilution Provisions: The conversion price of the Series A Preferred will be subject to a broad-based weighted average adjustment in the event that the Company issues additional equity securities at a purchase price less than the applicable conversion price.

**Problem:** This clause is an aggressive anti-dilution provision. It could potentially dilute the ownership stake of the founders and other early investors if the company issues additional equity at a lower price.

**Suggestion:** Consider a narrower anti-dilution provision that only triggers in the event of a 'down round', where shares are issued at a price lower than the Series A price.

## Issue 2: Board of Directors: The Board of Directors shall consist of 3 members. The holders of Series A Preferred, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect 1 director. The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect 2 directors.

**Problem:** This clause gives the Series A Preferred holders unilateral control over one-third of the board seats, which could potentially lead to a conflict of interest between the preferred shareholders and the common shareholders.

**Suggestion:** Consider a more balanced board structure, such as allowing the common shareholders to elect a majority of the board members.

## Issue 3: Protective Provisions: For so long as any shares of Series A Preferred remain outstanding, consent of the holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred shall be required for any action that...

**Problem:** This clause gives the Series A Preferred holders veto power over a wide range of corporate actions, which could limit the company's flexibility and potentially lead to a deadlock in decision-making.

**Suggestion:** Consider narrowing the scope of the protective provisions to only include actions that would materially and adversely affect the rights of the Series A Preferred holders.

---

## Issue 4: Restrictions on Sales: The founders shall not sell, transfer, or encumber more than 10% of their shares without Board approval.

**Problem:** This clause imposes a problematic transfer restriction on the founders. It could limit the founders' liquidity and potentially discourage them from continuing to contribute to the company's success.

**Suggestion:** Consider a more flexible transfer restriction, such as allowing the founders to sell a certain percentage of their shares after a specified period of time.

---

## Issue 5: Exclusivity: The Company agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or entertain any inquiries or proposals from, (ii) discuss or negotiate with, (iii) provide any information to, or (iv) consider the merits of any inquiries or proposals from, any person or entity (other than the Investors) relating to any business combination transaction involving the Company, including the sale of a majority of the Company's stock or assets, until [EXCLUSIVITY DATE] or the date on which the Investors have notified the Company that they are no longer interested in pursuing the transaction, whichever is earlier.

**Problem:** This clause imposes an unusual and one-sided termination right. It could potentially limit the company's ability to explore other financing options and negotiate the best terms.

**Suggestion:** Consider a shorter exclusivity period or allow the company to terminate the exclusivity if it receives a superior proposal from another investor.
