# SAFE (SIMPLE AGREEMENT FOR FUTURE EQUITY)
# {{company_name|default("[COMPANY NAME], INC.")}}

THIS CERTIFIES THAT in exchange for the payment by [INVESTOR NAME] (the "Investor") of {{amount|default("[AMOUNT]")}} (the "Purchase Amount") on or about [DATE], {{company_name|default("[COMPANY NAME], INC.")}} a [STATE] corporation (the "Company"), issues to the Investor the right to certain shares of the Company's Capital Stock, subject to the terms described below.

## 1. EVENTS

### (a) Equity Financing

If there is an Equity Financing before the termination of this SAFE, on the initial closing of such Equity Financing, this SAFE will automatically convert into the number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Conversion Price.

In connection with the automatic conversion of this SAFE into shares of Safe Preferred Stock, the Investor will execute and deliver to the Company all of the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided, that such documents (i) are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of Standard Preferred Stock, with appropriate variations for the Safe Preferred Stock if applicable, and (ii) have customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor, including (without limitation) limited representations, warranties, liability and indemnification obligations for the Investor.

### (b) Liquidity Event

If there is a Liquidity Event before the termination of this SAFE, this SAFE will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of such Liquidity Event, equal to the greater of (i) the Purchase Amount (the "Cash-Out Amount") or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price (the "Conversion Amount"). If any of the Company's securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice, provided that the Investor may not choose to receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to receive as a result of the Investor's failure to satisfy any requirement or limitation generally applicable to the Company's securityholders, or under any applicable laws.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may reduce the cash portion of Proceeds payable to the Investor by the amount determined by its board of directors in good faith for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that such reduction (A) does not reduce the total Proceeds payable to such Investor and (B) is applied in the same manner and on a pro rata basis to all securityholders who have equal priority to the Investor under Section 1(d).

### (c) Dissolution Event

If there is a Dissolution Event before the termination of this SAFE, the Investor will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds equal to the Cash-Out Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event.

### (d) Liquidation Priority

In a Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event, this SAFE is intended to operate like standard non-participating Preferred Stock. The Investor's right to receive its Cash-Out Amount is:

(i) Junior to payment of outstanding indebtedness and creditor claims, including contractual claims for payment and convertible promissory notes (to the extent such convertible promissory notes are not actually or notionally converted into Capital Stock);

(ii) On par with payments for other SAFEs and/or Preferred Stock, and if the applicable Proceeds are insufficient to permit full payments to the Investor and such other SAFEs and/or Preferred Stock, the applicable Proceeds will be distributed pro rata to the Investor and such other SAFEs and/or Preferred Stock in proportion to the full payments that would otherwise be due; and

(iii) Senior to payments for Common Stock.

The Investor's right to receive its Conversion Amount is (A) on par with payments for Common Stock and other SAFEs and/or Preferred Stock who are also receiving Conversion Amounts or Proceeds on a similar as-converted to Common Stock basis, and (B) junior to payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) above (in the latter case, to the extent such payments are Cash-Out Amounts or similar liquidation preferences).
